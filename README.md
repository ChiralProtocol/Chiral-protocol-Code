# Chiral-protocol-Code
Chiral Protocol code is open source and made available to  everybody to verify the contract. 

CPF applies a 4% tax on every sell transaction,  0% tax on every buy transaction, and 2% on other transaction. 2% of the fee is distributed among holders,
 1% sent to limitless blackhole (burn addresses), 
and 1% locked in the smart contract. (The tax fees can be manipulated through governance). The 2% fees on other transaction is automatically distributed among holders. 

Chiral Protocol is an advanced elastic supply rebase token with a deflationary mechanism, it combines rebase token mechanism
with frictionless yield, deflationary (burn) and inflation mechanism to reward holders.

CPF is pegged to Ethereum with a baseline of 0.005 ETH, meaning that if the price of Ethereum is $1,600 then the price of CPF must be above $8 ($1600 X 0.005) for a rebase to happen
CPF has been designed with a completely randomized rebase function. This means that no one can preemptively manipulate the price, 
If the price is below peg then nothing happen, you wouldn't lose any token.
CPF has a lag of 10 with a base cap of 10%, this means that when the price of CPF doubles then holders get 10% extra token of their tokens automatically distributed into their wallets.


Every day at 20:00 UTC, the contract automatically increasing the balance of each holder without the need for a single transaction. 
For the first week, the holders will get every day 1% more tokens. After that, 
for 1 week it will be 0.45% per day. After that period — 0.2% every day, for a lifetime.
